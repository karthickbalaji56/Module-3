# List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Python’s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

## 🧾 Program
```
items=[1,6,4,7,8,9,5,3]
sum_numbers=0
for x in items:
       sum_numbers+=x
print(sum_numbers)
```

## Output

## Result
The program successfully creates sum of all elements in list
